# Alex-Friendsim
So essentially, my prototype idea took a while to conjure up. I used to be insanely creative growing up and would be able to make my own universes and characters for those universes but as I’m getting older, I’ve struggled to reach and grab that creativity. Most of my art I make circulates around myself. It doesn’t help that I’ve been focusing on making a brand identity for myself. Since this semester and all of my projects have been about myself, I figured it would be nice to keep the theme. My first idea, though, came from dating sim games. My two choices were either making a dating sim for one of the characters I’ve drawn before or making a friendship simulator of myself. I went with me for a few reasons. The first reason is that I already had some graphics and a color palette picked out for my personal brand which I could incorporate into my game. I also have a habit of wanting to design my own graphics, but I have a lot of big projects on my hands at the moment but still wanted to do some design work. I designed all the images: the lives, the title cover, the game cover, and the thank you for playing cover. I feel it’s simple but me. I also liked the idea of there being a risk to my game and consequences to the choices the players would make. Though the consequences aren’t very serious and the options make the right choice a little obvious, I still like the outcome of what the player would choose. Another reason and the final reason why I’ve made the choices I’ve made to make this game is I’ve been struggling with making friends in my adult age. I can count on one hand how many friends I have and while that isn’t necessarily a bad thing, I feel like even just making acquaintances rough. I thought this game, though silly, would actually be a jump start into a conversation with someone in hopes of friendship. 
One difficulty I’ve encountered with writing this story is figuring out how well I know myself. One would think it would be easy to know myself, but I’ve been so caught up in all the aspects of what’s going on around me that I’ve lost sight of who I really am. I don’t even believe that the questions I’ve added fully encompass who I am but just some silly questions that are conversation starters into things I like but not necessarily who I am. Choosing these questions took me a couple of days and there are only four of them. Another difficulty I had was simplicity. I tend to overcomplicate things to an extreme and wanted to do a lot for this project. I found I just didn’t have the time to do what I wanted and tried to simplify it as much as possible. I wanted to make character sprites and backgrounds and have double the amount of questions, but it just wasn’t feasible for many reasons. Not only just time but also with the restrictions of the program I’m using. I’ve only ever used Construct 3 a year or so back in Intro to Game Design so this is my first time ever working with Twine. I thought it would be a good program to use since I’ve seen Kat work with it for other game design classes. This was a huge learning curve for me and I wouldn’t have been able to add the images in or change the font color and background without Kat’s help so I appreciate that from them. I’ve always found it hard to learn new programs on the spot and their help with the coding made things a lot easier. I did have some issues keeping the storyline consistent with the different options there are. Sometimes the same question would be split up three different times and on Twine, you can’t name two different passages the same name or they’ll link together. To maintain the life system I implemented, I had to edit some of the dialogue options. For example, I had to type up “seafood only” and “only seafood” so that a player who lost a heart earlier in the game continues to be missing that heart. I do want to continue to learn Twine as I feel it's a relatively simple program to get the hang of and I can see it being helpful for future projects. 
The non-linear aspects I chose for the storyline of the game as well as the player experience are self-explanatory with the concept of the game itself: Can you or can you not become friends with me? While in reality, these options aren’t an immediate game over trying to become my friend, it is a way for someone to know my likes and dislikes and to talk to me about them. Icebreaker conversations are key to getting to know someone and while these aren’t necessarily those types of questions, they are good talking points to spark conversations. My intended experience for players is to get to know me a little with questions geared toward my interests. I know this game is a little silly and might not be the most creative, but I thought it would be a nice and laid-back experience to get to know me a little.
